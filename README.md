### Etch of Life

This is a javascript implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) with interactive etch-a-sketch inspired drawing functionality. Life patterns found in this game were taken from the [Life Lexicon](https://conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex.htm).
