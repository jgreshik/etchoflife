Similar glider-emitting interactions were later found by Gabriel Nivasch and Jason Summers. The basic idea of the spaceship design is that streams of gliders created in this way can be used to construct fleets of standard spaceships which convey gliders to the front of the blinker tracks, where they can be used to build more blinkers. A different Caterpillar may be possible based on the following reaction, in which the pattern at top left reappears after 31 generations displaced by (13,1), having produced a new NW-travelling glider.

It is an important consideration when building something using reflectors. The colour of a glider can be defined as follows. First choose some cell to be the origin. This cell is then considered to be white, and all other cells to be black or white in a checkerboard pattern. (So the cell with coordinates (m,n) is white if m+n is even, and black otherwise.) Then the colour of a glider is the colour of its leading cell when it is in a phase that can be rotated to look like this: A reflector that does not change the colour of gliders obviously cannot be used to move a glider onto a path of different colour than it started on. But a 90-degree reflector that does change the colour of gliders is similarly limited, as the colour of the resulting glider will depend only on the direction of the glider, no matter how many reflectors are used. For maximum flexibility, therefore, both types of reflector are required. Small periodic colour-changing glider reflectors (bouncers) are known, and also small periodic colour-preserving glider reflectors (bumpers). Among stable patterns, only a small colour-preserving reflector (Snark) is known.

The input glider stream comes in from the upper left, and the output glider streams leave at the upper and lower right. One of the output glider streams is inverted, so an inverting reflector is required to complete the duplicator. To produce non-parallel output, an inline inverter could be substituted for the northmost p30 glider gun. Spaceship convoys that can duplicate gliders are very useful since they (along with glider turners) provide a means to clean up many dirty puffers by duplicating and turning output gliders so as to impact into the exhaust to clean it up.

Perhaps the most interesting glider syntheses are those of spaceships, because these can be used to create corresponding guns and rakes. Many of the c/2 spaceships that are based on standard spaceships have been synthesized, mostly by Mark Niemiec. In June 1998 Stephen Silver found syntheses for some of the Corderships (although it was not until July 1999 that Jason Summers used this to build a Cordership gun).

Initial attempts to construct a synthesis for this spaceship got fairly close, but it was only in March 2003 that Summers and Elkies managed to find a way to perform the crucial last step. Summers then used the new synthesis to build a c/2 forward rake for the 2c/5 spaceship; this was the first example in Life of a rake which fires spaceships that travel in the same direction as the rake but more slowly.

The original purpose in investigating CA rules including B3/S23 was to show that a very simple two-state rule could support a universal computer and/or universal constructor. If all finite patterns could be proven to be bounded, neither of these would be possible. An interesting question is: What is the minimum population of a pattern that exhibits infinite growth?

In October 2014, Michael Simkin discovered a three-glider collision that produces a glider-producing stabilized switch engine and thus produces infinite growth from the smallest possible number of gliders (since all 71 2-glider collisions have a finite limit population). Also of interest is the following pattern (again found by Callahan), which is the only 5x5 pattern with infinite growth. This too emits a block-laying switch engine.'],['infinite growth-3','Following a conjecture of Nick Gotts, Stephen Silver produced, in May 1998, a pattern of width 1 which exhibits infinite growth. This pattern was very large (12470x1 in the first version, reduced to 5447x1 the following day). In October 1998 Paul Callahan did an exhaustive search, finding the smallest example, the 39x1 pattern shown below. This produces two block-laying switch engines, stability being achieved at generation 1483. Larger patterns have since been constructed that display quadratic growth. Although the simplest infinite growth patterns grow at a rate that is (asymptotically) linear, many other types of growth rate are possible, quadratic growth (see also breeder) being the fastest. Dean Hickerson has found many patterns with unusual growth rates, such as sawtooths and a caber tosser. Another pattern with superlinear but non-quadratic growth is Gotts dots.

Depending on the period of the stream, different mechanisms can be used. For adding a spaceship to an existing multi-lane convoy, see inserter. For large period glider streams, simple reactions such as LWSS-LWSS bounce and LWSS-glider bounce suffice. If Herschel technology is used, a large number of edge shooters and transparent conduits are known. Simple examples include the NW31 Herschel-to-glider converter and the Fx119 inserter. Shown below is an injector found by Dave Buckingham that can fill a hole in a p15 glider stream: For very low-period glider streams, a GIG is a much more efficient insertion method, in the sense that fewer synchronized signals are needed.

Other new puffer speeds followed over the next several years. Many spaceships that travel orthogonally at a speed less than c/2 have useful side or back sparks. These can be used to perturb standard spaceships that approach from behind. A common technique for creating puffers for a new speed uses a convoy of the new spaceships to create debris from an approaching standard spaceship such that a new standard spaceship is recreated on the same path as the original one. This forms a closed loop, resulting in a high-period puffer for the new speed. As of June 2018, puffers have been found matching every known velocity of elementary spaceship, except for c/6 and c/7 diagonal and (2,1)c/6.

A pattern that is damaged or destroyed during the reflection process is generally called a one-time turner instead. The first known reflector was the pentadecathlon, which functions as a 180-degree glider reflector (see relay). Other examples include the buckaroo, the twin bees shuttle and some oscillators based on the traffic jam reaction. Glider guns can also be made into reflectors, although these are mostly rather large. In September 1998 Noam Elkies found some fast small-period glider reflectors, with oscillators supplying the required domino sparks at different periods. A figure-8 produced a p8 bouncer, and a p6 pipsquirter produced an equivalent p6 bouncer. A more complicated construction allows a p5 bouncer (which, as had been anticipated, soon led to a true p55 Quetzal gun). And in August 1999 Elkies found a suitable sparker to produce a p7 bouncer, allowing the first p49 oscillator to be constructed. These were all called simply "p5 reflector", "p6 reflector", etc., until 6 April 2016 when Tanner Jacobi discovered an equally small and simple reaction, the bumper, starting with a loaf as bait instead of a boat. This resulted in a series of periodic colour-preserving reflectors, whereas Elkies\' bouncer reflectors are all colour-changing. A useful mnemonic is that "bouncer" contains a C and is colour-changing, whereas "bumper" contains a P and is colour-preserving. Stable reflectors are special in that if they satisfy certain conditions they can be used to construct oscillators of all sufficiently large periods. It was known for some time that stable reflectors were possible (see universal constructor), but no one was able to construct an explicit example until Paul Callahan did so in October 1996. Callahan\'s original reflector has a repeat time of 4840, soon improved to 1686, then 894, and then 850. In November 1996 Dean Hickerson found a variant in which this is reduced to 747. Dave Buckingham reduced it to 672 in May 1997 using a somewhat different method, and in October 1997 Stephen Silver reduced it to 623 by a method closer to the original. In November 1998 Callahan reduced this to 575 with a new initial reaction. A small modification by Silver a few days later brought this down to 497. In April 2001 Dave Greene found a 180-degree stable reflector with a repeat time of only 202 (see boojum reflector). This reflector won bounties offered by Dieter Leithner and Alan Hensel. Half of the prize money was recycled into a new prize for a small 90-degree reflector, which in turn was won by Mike Playle\'s colour-preserving Snark reflector. The Snark is currently the smallest known stable reflector, with a recovery time of 43. Playle has offered a $100 prize for a colour-changing stable reflector contained within a 25 by 25 bounding box, with a recovery time of 50 generations or less. As of June 2018, the following splitter is among the smallest known 90-degree colour-changing reflectors. The top output can be blocked off by an eater if needed.

The following partially synchronized three-glider salvo produces an LWSS from a block. The above is a synchronized salvo and not a slow salvo, because the second glider must follow the first with the exact separation shown.

It successfully turns a 2c/3 signal by 90 degrees, but unfortunately changes it to a double-length signal in the process. This means that further copies of the converter can not be appended (e.g., to make a closed loop). Relatively small composite MWSS elbows can now be constructed, using Tanner Jacobi\'s 2015 discovery of a small H-to-MWSS component.

Each output spaceship therefore travels along a different path. Dieter Leithner constructed the first slide gun in July 1994 (although he used the term "side shooting gun"). The following pattern shows the key reaction of this slide gun. The three gliders shown will push the block one cell diagonally, thereby extending the length of the arm by one cell, and at the same time they release an output glider sideways. (In 1999, Jason Summers constructed slide guns using other reactions.)'],['sliding block memory','A memory register whose value is stored as the position of a block. The block can be moved by means of glider collisions. See block pusher for an example. In Conway\'s original formulation (as part of his proof of the existence of a universal computer in Life) two gliders were used to pull the block inwards by three diagonal spaces, as shown below, and thirty gliders were used to push it out by the same amount. Dean Hickerson later greatly improved on this, finding a way to pull a block inwards by one diagonal space using 2 gliders, and push it out the same distance using 3 gliders. In order for the memory to be of any use there also has to be a way to read the value held. It suffices to be able to check whether the value is zero (as Conway did), or to be able to detect the transition from one to zero (as Hickerson did). Dean Hickerson\'s sliding block memory is used in Paul Chapman\'s URM, and the key salvos from it are used in several other complex constructions, such as David Bell\'s Collatz 5N+1 simulator and Adam P.

This type of construction requires an initial seed object, such as a block, which is modified by each glider in turn until the desired object is produced. In May 1997, Nick Gotts produced a slow glider construction of a block-laying switch engine from a block, using a slow salvo of 53 gliders. Constructions like this are important in the study of sparse Life, as they will occur naturally as gliders created in the first few generations collide with blonks and other debris. Slow glider constructions are also useful in some designs for universal constructors. However, in this case the above definition is usually too restrictive, and it is desirable to allow constructions in which some gliders in the salvo are required to have a particular timing modulo 2 (a "p2 slow salvo"). This gives much greater flexibility, as blinkers can now be freely used in the intermediate construction steps. The Snarkmaker is a very large p2 slow salvo. A much smaller example is the following edgy construction of an eater1 starting from a block. Adam P.

Infinite soups may remain chaotic indefinitely since any reaction, no matter how rare, is bound to happen somewhere. Soups can have an average density, with results varying based on that. See sparse Life for a discussion of what can happen at a low density. Finite soups for sizes such as 16x16 (asymmetric) have been examined by the billions by scripts such as apgsearch to find interesting results. Many new oscillators and synthesis recipes have been discovered, as well as previously known rare patterns such as stabilized switch engines. In addition, soups are used to generate statistical census data, and to decide whether specific objects can be considered natural. Soups can be fully random, or they can be forced to be symmetric. The results for these two types of soups can differ since symmetric soups tend to create large symmetrical objects at a much higher rate.

The above mechanisms can be used to build intermitting glider guns. The left-hand eater produces a spark nine ticks after a glider impact, with the result that the period of the constituent guns can\'t be a multiple of 4. The right-hand eater produces the same spark ten ticks after impact, which allows p4N guns to be used. The separation of the spark also allows this reaction to perform other perturbations "around the corner" of some objects.

For the purposes of enumerating still lifes this definition is, however, unsatisfactory because, for example, any pair of blocks would count as a still life, and there would therefore be an infinite number of 8-bit still lifes. For this reason a stricter definition is often used, counting a stable pattern as a strict still life only if its islands cannot be divided into two or more nonempty sets both of which are stable in their own right. If such a subdivision can be made, the pattern can be referred to as a constellation. If its cells form a single cluster it is also, more specifically, either a pseudo still life or a quasi still life. In rare cases above a certain size threshold, a pattern may be divisible into three or four stable nonempty subsets but not into two. See the 32-bit triple pseudo (32 bits) and the 34-bit quad pseudo for examples. All still lifes up to 18 bits have been shown to be glider constructible. It is an open question whether all still lifes can be incrementally constructed using glider collisions. For a subset of small still lifes that have been found to be especially useful in self-constructing circuitry, see also Spartan. The smallest still life is the block. Arbitrarily large still lifes are easy to construct, for example by extending a canoe or barge.

The eater1 in the lower left corner catches the restart glider if no input signal has come in to create the beehive.

In August 1998 Stephen Silver proved that odd-period superstrings are impossible.) Sometimes a finite section of a superstring can be made to run between two tracks ("waveguides"). This gives a fuse which can be made as wide as desired. The first example was found by Tony Smithurst and uses tubs. (This is shown below. The superstring itself is p4 with a repeating section of width 9 producing one blinker per period and was one of those discovered in 1971. With the track in place, however, the period is 8. This track can also be used with a number of other superstrings.) Shortly after seeing this example, in March 1997 Peter Rott found another superstring track consisting of boats. At present these are the only two waveguides known. Both are destroyed by the superstring as it moves along. It would be interesting to find one that remains intact.

These may be toggle circuits, where the state of the switch changes after each use, or permanent switches that retain the same state through many uses until a change is made with a separate signal. More generally, any circuit may be referred to as a switch, if it can alter its output based on stored information. For example, the following simple mechanism based on an eater2 was discovered by Emerson J. Perkins in 2007. It either reflects or absorbs an incoming signal, depending on the presence or absence of a nearby block. The block is removed if a reflection occurs. The switching signal here is a glider produced by a high-clearance syringe variant found by Matthias Merzenich. The syringe is not technically part of the switch mechanism; any standard Herschel source can deliver the signal to the block factory (the two eater1s on the right side of the pattern). Alternate converter mechanisms could also be used to place the block. An earlier example of the same type of one-time switch mechanism, also mediated by a block, can be found in the NW34T204 H-to-G.

Corderman found several ways to stabilize the switch engine to produce puffers, using either one or two switch engines in tandem. See stabilized switch engine and ark. No spaceships were able to be made from switch engines until Dean Hickerson found the first one in April 1991 (see Cordership). Switch engine technology is now well-advanced, producing many c/12 diagonal spaceships, puffers, and rakes of many periods. Small polyominoes exist whose evolution results in a switch engine. See nonomino switch engine predecessor. Several three-glider collisions produce dirty reactions that produce a stabilized switch engine along with other ash, making infinite growth. Until recently the only known syntheses for clean unstabilized switch engines used four or more gliders. There are several such recipes. In the reaction shown below no glider arrives from the direction that the switch engine will travel to, making it easier to repeat the reaction: Running the above for 20 ticks completes a kickback reaction with the top two gliders, resulting in the three-glider switch engine recipe discovered by Luka Okanishi on 12 March 2017.'],['switch engine channel','Two lines of boats (or other suitable objects, such as tub with tails) arranged so that a switch engine can travel between them, in the following manner: David Bell used this in June 2005 to construct a "bobsled" oscillator, in which a switch engine factory sends switch engines down a channel, at the other end of which they are deleted.'],['symmetric','Any object which can be rotated and/or flipped over an axis and still maintain the same shape. Many common small objects such as the block, beehive, pond, loaf, clock, and blinker are symmetric. Some larger symmetric objects are Kok\'s galaxy, Achim\'s p16, cross, Eureka, and the pulsar. Large symmetric objects can easily be created by placing multiple copies of any finite object together in a symmetrical way. Unless the individual objects interact significantly, this is considered trivial and is not considered further here (e.g., two LWSSs travelling together a hundred cells apart). There are two kinds of symmetry. Odd symmetry occurs when an object\'s line of reflection passes through the center of a line of cells. Objects with odd symmetry have an odd number of columns or rows, and can have a gutter. Even symmetry occurs when the line of reflection follows the boundary between two lines of cells. Objects with even symmetry have an even number of columns or rows. Because the Life universe and its rules are symmetric, all symmetric objects must remain symmetric throughout their evolution. Most non-symmetric objects keep their non-symmetry as they evolve, but some can become symmetric, especially if they result in a single object. Here is a slightly more complicated example where two gliders interact to form a blockade: Many useful objects are symmetric along an orthogonal axis. This commonly occurs by placing two copies of an object side by side to change the behaviour of the objects due to the inhibition or killing of new cells at their gutter interface. Examples of this are twin bees shuttle, centinal, and the object shown in puffer. Other useful symmetric objects are created by perturbing a symmetric object using nearby oscillators or spaceships in a symmetric manner. Examples of this are Schick engine, blinker ship, and hivenudger. Many spaceships found by search programs are symmetric because the search space for such objects is much smaller than for non-symmetrical spaceships. Examples include dart, 60P5H2V0, and 119P4H1V0.'],['syringe','A small stable converter found by Tanner Jacobi in March 2015, accepting a glider as input and producing an output Herschel As of June 2018 it is the smallest known converter of this type, so it is very often used to handle input gliders in complex signal circuitry, as described in Herschel circuit. A second glider can safely follow the first any time after 78 ticks, but overclocking also allows the syringe to work at a repeat time of 74 or 75 ticks. If followed by a dependent conduit a simple eater2 can be used instead of the large welded catalyst shown here. A ghost Herschel marks the output location.

For examples see Canada goose, fly, pushalong, sidecar and sparky. See also Schick engine, which consists of a tagalong attached to two LWSS (or similar). The following c/4 spaceship (Nicolay Beluchenko, February 2004) has two wings, either of which can be considered as a tagalong. But if either wing is removed, then the remaining wing becomes an essential component of the spaceship, and so is no longer a tagalong.'],['Tanner\'s p46','(p46) An oscillator found by Tanner Jacobi on 20 October 2017.

For example, a p46 glider gun can be made from a Tanner\'s p46 and just one of the twin bees shuttles. Acting on their own, two copies of Tanner\'s p46 placed at right angles to each other with their sparks interacting can produce two different p46 glider guns and a gliderless p46 MWSS gun.

The input glider will reach the same output location 128 generations sooner if the trombone slide is removed. If the top and left Snarks are moved together diagonally to the upper left by N cells, then the glider delay is increased by 8N generations since the glider has to travel N more cells in each direction. This sliding action gives the trombone slide its name. If only the final Snark is moved, then the output glider\'s path can be altered by a number of full diagonals. Trombone slides made of the same type of component cannot alter the glider path by half-diagonals, and can only change the timing by multiples of 8 generations.

Shown on the top row below are the four 90-degree turner reactions that use common small ash objects: boat, eater1, long boat, and toad. Of the reactions on the first row, the glider output is the same parity for all but the long boat. The three still lifes are all colour-changing, but the toad happens to be a colour-preserving turner. The third row shows an aircraft carrier serving as a "0-degree turner" that is also colour-changing. Three of the simplest 180-degree turners are shown in the second row. The Blockic 180-degree turner is colour-preserving. The long boat and long ship are again colour-changing; this is somewhat counterintuitive as the output glider is on exactly the same lane as the input glider, but gliders travelling in opposite directions on the same lane always have opposite colours. Many small one-time turner constellations have also been catalogued. The 90-degree two-block turner on the right, directly below the toad, is also colour-changing but has the opposite parity. A one-time turner reaction can be used as part of a glider injection mechanism, or as a switching mechanism for a signal. If a previous reaction has created the sacrificial object, then a later glider is turned onto a new path. Otherwise it passes through the area unaffected.
